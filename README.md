# Algorithms and Data Structures in C

Collection of classic algorithms and data structures implemented in C from my Data Structures and Algorithms coursework at Sheridan College.

## Contents

### Graph Algorithms
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: All-pairs shortest path algorithm with central node detection
  - Time complexity: O(V³)
  - Space complexity: O(V²)
  - Includes visualization of intermediate steps

### Data Structures
- **Binary Search Tree**: BST implementation with insert, search, and in-order traversal
  - Average case operations: O(log n)
  - File I/O for persistent storage

## Usage

Each directory contains:
- Source code (`.c` files)
- Compilation instructions
- Sample input/output

## Compilation
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

## Course
Completed as part of Algorithm Development and Data Structures course at Sheridan College.
